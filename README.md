# F1 Weather Randomizer

This basic tool was created to randomize race weather for a track ahead of a scheduled race in F1 22.

## The Numbers

Arbitrary numbers are used (for now) to calculate the likelihood of a wet race. The base likelihood is used to select the weather for the first stint of the race. Subsequent stints are selected by prioritizing similar/same weather types and taking into consideration the overall chance for a wet race at that track.
